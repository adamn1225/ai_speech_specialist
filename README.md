### Data Flow

1. Audio captured from system or microphone
2. Real-time chunking (3-second segments, 0.5s overlap)
3. Local transcription via Whisper.cpp
4. Feature extraction (tone, clarity, volume, fillers)
5. Scoring and alert generation
6. UI updates and user feedback

### Performance

- **Latency**: <500ms for real-time analysis
- **Accuracy**: Professional-grade speech metrics
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for continuous operation
- **Offline**: Full functionality without internet

## Configuration

### Audio Settings
- Sample rate: 16kHz (optimized for Whisper)
- Chunk duration: 3 seconds
- Overlap: 0.5 seconds
- Input source: Auto-detect or manual selection

### Analysis Thresholds
- Speaking rate: 150-200 WPM
- Filler words: <5% of total words
- Volume consistency: >80%
- Pitch variance: Natural prosody range

### Scoring Weights
- Tone: 25%
- Clarity: 25%
- Volume: 20%
- Fluency: 30%

## API Integration

### OpenAI Configuration

1. Obtain API key from OpenAI
2. Set in Settings â†’ OpenAI API
3. Configure models:
   - Transcription: whisper-1 (cloud) or local
   - Analysis: gpt-4o-mini (recommended)

### Usage Monitoring

The application tracks API usage and provides estimates. Cloud features are optional - full functionality available offline.

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
- **No audio detected**: Check PulseAudio configuration
- **Permission denied**: Ensure user is in audio group
- **Poor quality**: Adjust input levels and sample rate

### Performance Issues
- **High latency**: Reduce chunk duration or disable cloud features
- **CPU usage**: Close other audio applications
- **Memory usage**: Restart application periodically for long sessions

### Whisper Issues
- **Model not found**: Re-download with provided script
- **Slow transcription**: Check CPU availability and model size
- **Poor accuracy**: Ensure clear audio input and proper microphone
