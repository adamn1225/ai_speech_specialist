# Speech Coach Icon Instructions

## Creating a Professional Icon

For a professional Windows application, you'll want to create a proper .ico file.

### Quick Options:

1. **Online Icon Generator**:
   - Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
   - Use text: "ðŸŽ¤" or "SC"
   - Background color: #4CAF50 (green)
   - Text color: white
   - Download as .ico file

2. **Free Icon Resources**:
   - https://icons8.com/ (search "microphone")
   - https://www.flaticon.com/ (search "speech")
   - Make sure to use royalty-free icons

3. **Create with GIMP/Photoshop**:
   - Size: 256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 48x48, 32x32, 16x16
   - Format: .ico file
   - Include microphone/speech bubble imagery

### For Now:
I'll create a simple placeholder icon that you can replace later.

### Suggested Icon Elements:
- ðŸŽ¤ Microphone symbol
- ðŸ“Š Waveform/chart
- ðŸ’¬ Speech bubble
- ðŸŽ¯ Target/improvement symbol
- Colors: Green (#4CAF50), Blue (#2196F3), Dark Gray (#2b2b2b)

Place your final icon as: assets/speech_coach_icon.ico
